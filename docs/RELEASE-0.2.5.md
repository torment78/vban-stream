# VBAN Stream 0.2.5 — pre-release

A refreshed installer and clearer incoming-stream information for VBAN Stream on Windows x64.

## Changes

- Dark navy installer and uninstaller matching VBAN Plug, with VBAN Stream artwork, the original plugin icon, ElkaSoft branding and a Donate button.
- The installer retains the standard/portable OBS choices, folder browsing, validation and settings-preservation behavior.
- Every incoming slot now has a boxed **Channels** count and **Input format**, showing the actual incoming audio before OBS downmixing.
- **Receiving: N / 8 streams** counts live streams, not channels or duplicate OBS source instances. Waiting, disabled, errored and timed-out streams show a dash instead of stale values.

Each named stream accepts 1–8 channels automatically. One source remains one mixer fader. For eight-channel OBS output, select 7.1 and a compatible output format; Stereo downmixes incoming audio. Both monitor returns remain stereo, with independently selectable PCM16 or PCM24.

## Validation

Built with Visual Studio 2026. All 12 core/OBS tests passed on OBS 31.1.1, followed by the monitor-return test and all eight incoming-channel cases on OBS 32.2.1. Tests include live channel/PCM changes, input indicators, timeouts and native OBS meter lanes. All 53 standard/portable installer checks passed. The installer and both ZIP layouts contain the same tested plugin DLL.

## Downloads
