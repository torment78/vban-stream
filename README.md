# VBAN Stream

**Eight VBAN audio inputs and two monitor-mix returns for OBS Studio on Windows x64.**

An independent plugin by **ElkaSoft** for OBS Studio.

Receive named VBAN streams with 1–8 channels each directly in OBS. Send the OBS monitoring mix back to
two computers, each with its own destination address, UDP port, and stream name.

## Download and install

The files below are the **0.2.5 pre-release**. The latest stable version is **0.2.2** and retains the earlier VBAN Audio name. Tested with **OBS 31.1.1** and **OBS 32.2.1** on Windows x64.

| Download | Where it goes |
| --- | --- |
| **vban-stream-0.2.5-windows-x64-setup.exe** | Dark installer with VBAN Stream artwork for **standard or portable OBS**. Finds installed OBS or lets you browse to its root folder. |
| **vban-stream-0.2.5-obs-root.zip** | Merge its **obs-plugins** and **data** folders into the OBS installation folder. Works with **normal and portable OBS**. |
| **vban-stream-0.2.5-windows-x64.zip** | Copy its **obs-vban-audio** folder into **C:\ProgramData\obs-studio\plugins** for a normal OBS installation. |

### macOS test build

The [0.2.6 Mac pre-release](https://github.com/torment78/vban-stream/releases/tag/v0.2.6-macos.1)
is for testing on **macOS 13 or later**, with **OBS Studio 31.1.1 or later**.
The universal `.plugin` bundle contains both Apple Silicon and Intel code.

Use the Mac `.pkg` installer or copy the bundle from the ZIP into
`~/Library/Application Support/obs-studio/plugins`. Quit OBS before installation.
These test builds use ad-hoc signing and are not Apple notarized; the
[Mac installation and testing guide](docs/INSTALL-MAC.txt) explains approval and
includes a listening checklist. Sustained audio and real OBS GUI testing are still
required before promoting Mac support to a stable release.

The Windows downloads above remain the existing 0.2.5 build.

### Using the installer

1. Close OBS, run **vban-stream-0.2.5-windows-x64-setup.exe**, and approve the Windows administrator prompt.
2. Choose **Standard OBS installation** (selected by default) or **Portable OBS**.
3. Check the detected standard OBS folder, or click **Browse** to choose your portable
   OBS root: the folder containing **bin**, **data**, and **obs-plugins**.
4. Click **Next**, review the paths, then **Install**. Restart OBS and open
   **Tools → VBAN Stream Settings**.

Both installer modes put the DLL and data inside the selected OBS folder. Standard
mode adds a Windows Installed apps entry; portable mode keeps its uninstaller in
the plugin's data folder. The installer does not install OBS itself or enable
OBS portable mode. Your existing scenes, profiles and VBAN settings are preserved.

Already using the root ZIP? Select the same OBS folder to update it. If you used
the ProgramData ZIP, remove that plugin copy before switching to the installer.
Setup checks the usual ProgramData location in standard mode to prevent duplicate
copies. Close all OBS instances before installing or uninstalling.

### Manual ZIP installation

Use **one** layout and keep only one installed copy. Close OBS before copying files.
The root ZIP is the simplest option if you already install plugins by merging folders.

For a normal installation, the root layout is:

```text
C:\Program Files\obs-studio\
  obs-plugins\64bit\obs-vban-audio.dll
  data\obs-plugins\obs-vban-audio\locale\en-US.ini
  data\obs-plugins\obs-vban-audio\vban-audio.png
```

For portable OBS, use the same layout inside its own root folder.
Restart OBS and open **Tools → VBAN Stream Settings**.
The ZIPs also include **VBAN-INSTALL.txt**.

Requires the Microsoft Visual C++ x64 runtime. Uses the OBS installation's own
libobs, frontend API and Qt libraries. Do not copy development dependency DLLs
into OBS. These builds are unsigned.

## Receive VBAN audio in OBS

1. Open **Tools → VBAN Stream Settings**.
2. Enter the sender computer's IPv4 address and the UDP listen port (default **6980**).
3. Enable the slots you need. Enter each exact, case-sensitive VBAN stream name.
   Use **Friendly name** for the label you want in OBS.
4. Click **Apply**. Configure the sender to send to this OBS computer and the same port.
5. Add **Sources + → VBAN Stream**, then select the configured stream.

**Channels** in VBAN Stream Settings shows a small number box for each receiving stream: **2** for stereo, **4** for four channels, or **8** for eight channels. **Input format** beside it shows the received PCM bit depth or floating-point format. These are the incoming values before OBS downmixing. **Receiving** counts live streams, not individual channels or OBS source copies. A waiting, disabled or stopped stream shows a dash instead of an old channel count.

Each named stream automatically accepts **1–8 audio channels**; there is no
channel-count selector. The eight slots are eight separate streams, each of which
can carry up to eight channels. One source remains one mixer fader.

To retain all eight channels through OBS, set **Settings → Audio → Channels → 7.1**
and use an output/recording format that supports it. With OBS set to **Stereo**,
OBS downmixes multichannel input to stereo. Seven-channel input uses a silent
eighth channel. The two monitor returns remain stereo.

The source appears as a normal OBS mixer fader. Default source names adopt the
friendly name; manually assigned names are preserved. Multiple sources can select
the same slot without creating extra network receivers.

One sender/name pair should occupy one enabled slot. Stream names allow 1–16
printable ASCII characters. The stream dropdown stays open while you select it.

## Send the monitor mix back

1. Open **VBAN RETURNS** in the same settings window.
2. Under **Send from this PC**, select this OBS computer's LAN address and adapter.
   **Automatic** lets Windows select the route.
3. Enable Return 1 and/or Return 2. Choose **PCM 16-bit** or **PCM 24-bit** for each
   return, then enter its destination IPv4 address, incoming VBAN port, and stream name.
4. Leave **Return audio buffer** at **60 ms** initially, then click **Apply**.
5. In OBS **Advanced Audio Properties**, use **Monitor Only** or **Monitor and Output**
   for sources you want in the return. **Monitor Off** excludes a source.
6. In VoiceMeeter, enable an incoming VBAN stream with the matching name, port,
   and sender IP (the OBS computer).

Both returns carry the same stereo monitor mix, including source filters and fader
gains, encoded at their independently selected PCM bit depths. Existing settings
retain **PCM 24-bit**. Changing bit depth does not change the sample rate: with OBS
set to **48 kHz**, both returns remain at **48 kHz**. Each has an independent socket
and packet counter.

In tested Windows OBS 32.2.1, the normal program mute button does not mute headphone
monitoring, and the return follows that behavior. Use **Monitor Off** to remove
a source from the return. OBS 31.1.1 honors the monitoring capture mute flag.

Returns send silence when no monitored source contributes. **Sending** means
Windows accepted outgoing packets; it does not confirm remote reception.
The applied source and destination addresses appear beside each return.
An unavailable selected adapter produces an error instead of silently switching.

**Avoid feedback:** do not feed either received return into a VBAN stream that
comes back into OBS.

## Buffering and clicks

The return buffer is adjustable from **20 to 200 ms**, default **60 ms**.
Increasing it gives delayed source callbacks more time to arrive, at the cost of
additional monitor delay. Try **100 ms** if **Late audio frames** keeps increasing
during steady playback. VoiceMeeter's incoming network buffer is a separate setting.

Version 0.2.2 also doubles capture capacity to 128 blocks per monitored source and
corrects small source-clock differences through gradual interpolation. It fixes
gaps/overlaps at the former 1 ms clock-rounding threshold. The worker requests
Windows multimedia audio scheduling priority.

Hover over a return's status to see:

| Counter | What it tells you |
| --- | --- |
| Capture queue overflows / queue peak | Source capture is outrunning the return worker. |
| Late audio frames | Source audio arrived after its mixing deadline. |
| Clock corrections | Small drift adjustments; increasing normally is expected. |
| Clock discontinuities | Source timestamps jumped or restarted. |
| Clipped samples | The combined mix exceeded full scale. Lower source faders. |
| Invalid float samples | A source/filter supplied non-finite audio. |
| Socket errors | Windows rejected an outgoing packet. |
| Send gaps over 20 ms / largest gap | The local sender paused or was delayed. |

Compare changes during steady playback. Startup, source changes, and Apply can
affect counters. Audio counters follow current source lifetimes; send/clipping
counters reset when return settings are applied. A quiet upstream source is valid
silence, so these counters cannot identify every audible problem.

If local counters stay steady but VoiceMeeter reports reception errors, check the
network and receiver, including its VBAN network-quality/buffering setting.
Clean local counters alone do not prove packet delivery. The plugin does not
change firewall, VPN, router, or audio-device settings.

## Supported input audio

Unsigned PCM8; signed PCM16/24/32; Float32 and Float64; one to eight channels.
Seven channels are padded to eight for OBS's 7.1 layout. Channel order is preserved.
Compressed/non-audio VBAN, invalid payloads, non-finite floats, and more than eight
channels are rejected. Packet parsing checks the 28-byte header and 1464-byte limit.

The eight-input receiver retains its existing 30 ms jitter target and approximately
10 ms output blocks, independently of the new return buffer. It tracks lost,
reordered, duplicate, late, invalid and unsupported packets plus under/overruns.
Missing input packets can cause silence and clicks upstream of the return.
No buffer reconstructs audio that never arrives.

## Build in Visual Studio 2026

Install **Desktop development with C++**, **MSVC v145**, **Windows SDK 10.0.26100.0**
and **C++ CMake tools for Windows**. CMake 4.3 or newer is required.
No .NET/C# project or separate Qt installation is needed.

To build the current pre-release, clone the dev branch into a working folder, then run PowerShell there:

```powershell
git clone --branch dev https://github.com/torment78/vban-stream.git
cd obs-vban-audio
.\tools\build.ps1 -Package
```

The script finds Visual Studio 2026 (including Insiders), downloads pinned official
OBS/Qt dependencies on first configuration, builds with MSBuild, and runs tests.
The SDK baseline is OBS **31.1.1** and the **2025-07-11** dependencies (Qt **6.8.3**).

After initial configuration, open **build_x64\obs-vban-audio.slnx** in Visual Studio
2026. Select **RelWithDebInfo | x64**, then **Build → Build Solution**.
Alternatively open the repository as a CMake folder and choose **windows-x64**.

Outputs are in **build_x64\RelWithDebInfo** and **dist**.

To add the EXE installer, install [Inno Setup 6](https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php),
then run the following after the Visual Studio build/package step:

```powershell
.\tools\package-installer.ps1
```

This packages the same DLL as the root ZIP and verifies it matches the Visual
Studio build. See [installer build and testing notes](docs/INSTALLER.md).
Tests use isolated OBS configurations and local UDP receivers. They do not play
through physical speakers or change your normal OBS or VoiceMeeter setup.

```powershell
.\tools\run-tests.ps1
```

The optional OBS 32.2.1 compatibility host uses matching frontend headers and the
official runtime under **.deps**; **tools\run-tests-obs32.ps1** runs that check when
those optional files are available. They are not included in release downloads.
See the [audio review](docs/AUDIO-REVIEW-0.2.2.md) for validation and limitations.

Releases are built and tested locally with Visual Studio 2026. Inherited template
GitHub workflows are disabled until adapted and validated for this toolchain.
